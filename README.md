# BIDS example with HED-SCORE schema library annotations

The HED schema library for the Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE) can be used to add annotations for BIDS datasets. The annotations are machine readable and validated with the BIDS and HED validators. 

This example is related to the following preprint:

# General information
This BIDS example dataset includes iEEG data from one subject that were measured during clinical photic stimulation. Intracranial EEG data were collected at Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN under IRB#: 15-006530.  

# Events
The events are annotated according to the HED-SCORE schema library. Data are annotated by adding a column for annotations in the _events.tsv. The levels and annotations in this column are defined in the _events.json sidecar as HED tags.
